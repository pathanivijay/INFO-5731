"I’ve purchased many Razer products, and from my experience with Razer, every single product I had had some sort of fatal problem eventually, with normal use.I decided to give them one last chance because I do love their Synapse program where you have control over everything, and they are actually stylish and relatively good quality products.This Wireless Viper Ultimate is lightweight, very responsive, and has very low delay. It feels good in the hand, and the left and right clicks need just the perfect force to click. Some of their other mice give you the option to change the force needed to click, so given that this one doesn’t, they have it set in a sweets spot.One thing I love about the mouse is that the USB receiver can be plugged directly into the charging dock, so you don’t need 2 USB slots on your computer I/O for the charging dock, and the USB receiver.The mouse is white, so I’m not sure if it will get discolored and rub off with time.It feels good in the hand, but I have one (avoidable) issue, and that is this mouse is made for both hands, it’s symmetrical, meaning that the side buttons are on the left, and the right side. I noticed that specially while gaming, it’s so easy to click one of the 2 side buttons by mistake with your pinky or ring finger.My solution was to disable them from Razer Synapse, but it would have been nice to still have those extra buttons put in a way where both left handed and right handed people can use them without making unintentional clicks.The other minor thing is that the sensitivity adjustment button is located under the mouse, and no longer behind the scroll wheel like all their other mice, meaning you can not control the sensitivity on the go while playing an FPS game for example, you’d have to flip it around and cycle through them one by one. It does have an LED indicator to let you know which sensitivity you’re on though. They are determined in Razer Synapse.Battery life is OK, holds a charge for a couple of days with heavy use.Overall, good mouse right out the box. I will be happy if this one holds better than the previous ones. Still rooting for Razer!

"This mouse has multiple DPI settings which are changeable thru software from Razer. This is my 2nd Razer mouse (1st was NAGA, god tier mouse but its wired). Almost 2 or 3 years later and i have no issues with this mouse or the charger stand. Charges rather quick (maybe an hour if completely dead) and has withstood well over 100k clicks.My only downside was the side-grips weren't as sticky as i would like for intense gaming but it is rather light so its not an issue at all. I grabbed some rubber pads that had an adhesive side and applied it, worked wonders.Dongle has a bottom hatch to store in, great for on the go or storage.Works good when wired, not really noticeable.9.9/10 for sure all day.

"he Razer Viper Ultimate Hyperspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse, paired with its RGB Charging Dock, has undoubtedly raised the bar for my gaming experience. As an avid gamer, I've been on the hunt for a mouse that combines precision, speed, and wireless convenience, and Razer has delivered all that and more.The first thing that caught my attention was the mouse's lightweight design. It's incredibly comfortable to hold, and the ambidextrous shape ensures a perfect fit for both left and right-handed gamers. The smooth, matte texture provides a secure grip, and I never experience hand fatigue even during marathon gaming sessions.The Hyperspeed wireless technology is a game-changer! The mouse boasts an almost imperceptible 1ms response time, which translates into instantaneous and lag-free movements. Gone are the days of being tethered by a cable – the wireless freedom enhances my gameplay and gives me a competitive edge.The Razer Viper Ultimate's optical sensor is nothing short of exceptional. With a DPI range of up to 20,000, I can customize the sensitivity to suit any gaming scenario. Whether I'm sniping from afar or engaging in fast-paced action, the mouse's accuracy ensures every movement is smooth and precise.The dedicated DPI clutch is a brilliant addition. By holding it, I can temporarily lower the DPI for those precise shots, making it a lifesaver in intense gaming situations.The RGB lighting is not just for aesthetics; it's customizable to indicate the battery level, which is incredibly convenient. Speaking of which, the battery life is outstanding. The Viper Ultimate lasts for hours of continuous gaming, and when it's time to recharge, the included RGB Charging Dock makes it effortless and looks fantastic on my gaming setup.The programmable buttons are easily configurable through Razer Synapse, providing endless customization options. Creating and saving profiles for different games or genres has never been simpler.In addition to its gaming prowess, the Razer Viper Ultimate is versatile enough for everyday use. The precision and responsiveness carry over to everyday tasks, making it a reliable companion for work and productivity.In conclusion, the Razer Viper Ultimate Hyperspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse, along with the RGB Charging Dock, has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. Its lightweight design, hyperspeed wireless technology, and customizable features make it the ultimate gaming mouse. I couldn't be happier with my purchase from Amazon, and I highly recommend the Razer Viper Ultimate to any serious gamer seeking a top-tier gaming mouse that delivers on every promise.
